## What it is all about
Google Assistent and Amazon Alexa (among others) are becoming part of our daily routine and it is designed to make our life more comfotable and convinient by using voice commands. You can listen music, control you home with voice commands and ask for some information.

The critical part that is missing here is visual representation. The purpose of project is address visual aspect and help user to evluate persived information faster and in more efficiaent manner.

One of pottential points we trying to address (amont many others):

- "show me home status". It can potentially show all your devices statuses with their names (and commands can be used for each device).
This projects has been created to allow DYI developers have their own voice controlled home automation. 

- "show me video in Youtube".
- "track UPS status for package XXX"

and many others..

## Images
TBD    

## Contribution
Anything is helpfull (see [here](https://github.com/jviaches/Reflection/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) how): 
- create tickets, 
- report bugs
- fix bugs
- code features
- translations
- create/update documentation

## Hardware and Software
TBD..

Also the priority is move to voice control already at early stages and besides fun parts (like "show me youtube video" while shaving), it can also control ligts, smart thermostat( like Nest) and others IOT devices from different vendors.

## RoadMap
Currently we are in POC (prof of concept) stage to make sure we not only able to achieve our target, but also to choose right tools.
- Create Android Things image for Rasbery Pi Model B which include clock
- Voice commands for turn screen On/Off
- Voice command to set clock (since Rasbery does not have battery to hold current clock)

After completion of POC, we will update publish Roadmap as we see it. Stay tuned :)
